# Inferring Sleep Patterns from Google Takeout Data

## Overview
This repository contains the code and methodology used to analyze and interpret Google Takeout data from three group members. The goal of this project was to explore browsing activity and assess its potential as an indicator of sleep patterns. Each member independently collected and processed their data, applying unique analytical methods to visualize trends and draw conclusions.

## Data Collection
Generally, members retrieved their browsing history and activity logs from Google Takeout, a service that allows users to export their data from various Google platforms. The following steps were taken to obtain the dataset:

1. Navigated to the Google Takeout page.
2. Deselected all categories and manually selected Chrome and YouTube as relevant platforms.
3. Exported the selected data as a zipped folder.
4. Received the exported dataset via email for further processing.

To ensure data privacy, tracking permissions were disabled on business and school accounts, limiting the dataset primarily to activity from personal Google accounts.

## Methodology
Each group member employed their own approach to analyze and interpret the extracted data. The methodologies used are categorized into three evidence bases:

- Bella’s Google Takeout Information: Focused on identifying late-night browsing trends and assessing fluctuations across different months.
- Ryan’s Google Takeout Information: Examined seasonal variations in browsing patterns, identifying shifts in sleep behavior over time.
- Emmie’s Chrome Activity: Compared browsing activity with external sleep-tracking data from an iPhone Health app to evaluate accuracy and correlation.
